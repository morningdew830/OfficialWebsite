                    <h3>ELECTRICAL POWER & GAS MANAGEMENT</h3>
                    <p>Your cost of energy is affected by a number of factors that can change without notice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deregulation</li>
                        <li>Third-party supply options</li>
                        <li>Regulatory exemptions</li>
                        <li>The rate you pay</li>
                        <li>Rebates and more</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Brightergy energy supply managers constantly track local market factors, energy-hedging opportunities, and wholesale and retail pricing information, so we understand how each one will impact your energy costs.</p>

                    <h3>OPTIMIZE YOUR RATES</h3>
                    <p>Energy price management has evolved into enterprise-wide risk management, with its own set of skills and time commitment.</p>
                    <p>When and how you buy your energy matters – even in regulated utility service territories. But how do you make sense of the energy market, manage volatility, stay on budget, and still run your business?</p>
                    <p>You need a trusted partner that maintains relationships with key suppliers, but maintains its independence in order to secure the best possible price for its clients.</p>
                    <p>We deliver the critical insight you need to make informed sourcing decisions with confidence.</p>

                    <h3>REGULATED RATE ANALYSIS</h3>
                    <p>Brightergy Regulated Rate Analysis evaluates and recommends the optimum tariff structure in regulated service territories. In addition to assessing the various utility rates and tariff options, we evaluate demand response and other demand mitigation opportunities to drive energy savings.</p>
                    <p>Just because you’re in a regulated utility market with a monopoly energy provider doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to realize energy savings by restructuring and consolidating meters, accounts, and/or tariffs.</p>
