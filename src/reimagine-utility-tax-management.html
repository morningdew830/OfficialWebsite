                    <p>Approximately half of U.S. states make various utility tax incentives or other opportunities available. These range from full or partial exemptions to reduced rates based on industry, use of the utility, taxing jurisdiction, and more.</p>
                    <p>Even more opportunities exist in various local taxing jurisdictions around the U.S. Our team has been involved in utility tax consulting for over ten years, and has developed a working knowledge of tax issues in all 50 states.</p>
                    <p>We identify opportunities through a meticulous review of your billing information and respective tax law, and then qualify opportunities by completing the required direct-use or predominant-use studies.</p>
                    <p>We also complete and file the required documentation with the respective authorities â€“ and act as your advocate with the taxing authority, ensuring you receive the refunds and/or credits you earned.</p>
