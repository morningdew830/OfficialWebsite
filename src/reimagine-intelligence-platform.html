                    <h3>ACTIONABLE ENERGY INSIGHTS</h3>
                    <p>BrighterLink features an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for any organization that is looking to strategically manage their energy generation, consumption, and supply and turn what was once an operating cost – and a liability – into an asset. You no longer have to be an energy expert to access energy data.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT IS BRIGHTERLINK?</h3>
                    <p><img src="assets/img/article/iot.png" alt="" class="right"/>
                        Through the Internet of Things, every building can host a myriad of different data sources – sources that don’t communicate with each other – about energy and efficiency. BrighterLink collects device-agnostic data, normalizes it, and provides users with information and insights that they can then use to take some kind of action to better manage their energy, save both dollars and emissions, and start a conversation about it.</p>

                    <p>BrighterLink empowers you with the ability to collect vast energy data and then turn it into actionable energy intelligence.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>All of your sustainability data in one place</b>(Energy, gas, emissions – eventually sewage, water, and more.)</li>
                        <li><b>Device-agnostic data collection</b></li>
                        <li><b>Machine-Learning and Predictive Analysis</b></li>
                        <li><b>Ubiquitous API</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Brightergy will offer a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/brightergy.com/document/d/1S91bztCzUdb79Q2Uk37AY5xF86--vLDhD_ocj13Pk3M/edit#bookmark=id.gxr79el4hj35">suite of 8 proprietary apps</a> that live on BrighterLink and utilize its engines. But we believe there’s infinite possibility at the convergence of the IoT and distributed energy – possibility we can’t even see yet. Which is why BrighterLink features a ubiquitous API, open to all third-party developers, to use and develop app-based solutions.</p>

                        <p>A powerful collection engine gathers data from any potential data source, device-agnostic. This could be utility bills, sensors, weather forecasts, energy generation dataloggers – if it’s an energy data source, this engine will collect it.</p>

This is the power of BrighterLink’s Normalization Engine. This engine standardizes – or normalizes – the raw data collected and puts it into a standard schema.</p>

                        <p>In the past 10 years, machine learning – algorithmic systems that learn programs from data, and apply those findings to predict outcomes  – has given us web search, spam filters, fraud detection, and self-driving cars, and the set of possibilities is just beginning. Think how powerful that concept could be when applied to your historical energy data to predict future trends or behaviors. You could, for example, plan for solar energy production based on weather and past production data.</p>
