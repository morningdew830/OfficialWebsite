                    <p>Solar power is an excellent solution for what can often be an uncontrollable operating expense – your energy needs. Generate all or a portion of your energy needs with a clean, renewable fuel, and hedge against rate escalation.</p>
                    <h3>HOW DOES SOLAR ENERGY WORK?</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Solar panels absorb sunlight and convert it to direct current (DC) electricity.</li>
                        <li>DC electricity from the solar panels travels to inverters, where it is converted to alternating current (AC) electricity.</li>
                        <li>From the inverter, AC electricity passes to the electric service panel (breaker box) where it’s routed to power your building.</li>
                        <li>When your solar-energy system generates more power than your building is consuming, excess electricity is routed to the power grid. This earns credits on your bill (called net-metering).</li>
