                    <ul>
                        <li>Every lesson and activity is correlated to Common Core and Next Generation State Science Standards</li>
                        <li>10 lessons and 21 activities</li>
                        <li>Many of the lessons are based on an inquiry-style approach</li>
                        <li>Lessons and activities are designed to work all together, but also to stand alone, so that you can use them in whatever fashion makes the most sense for your classroom</li>
                        <li>While best suited for 5th through 8th grades, lessons can be adapted to K-12th grade</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While BrighterClassroom integrates with the energy projects at your school or district, the materials are not simply designed to teach about energy efficiency and solar energy: they include place-based, project-oriented lessons that build upon one another and get students asking big picture questions about how we use and experience energy in our daily lives.</p>
                    <p>BrighterClassroom provides supplemental material and instruction about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Energy forms and sources</li>
                        <li>Understanding energy conservation and efficiency</li>
                        <li>The benefits of efficient lighting and the value of renewable, specifically, solar, energy in meeting current and future energy needs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>April 7, 2013 – President and Chelsea Clinton ended their <a href="http://www.cgiu.org/">Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U)</a> weekend in St. Louis with a Day of Action at Gateway STEM High School. CGI U participants also celebrated the school’s new 25 kilowatt solar-energy system, donated in-kind by Brightergy.</p>
                    <p>Gateway students will learn from BrighterClassroom lessons that integrate their system’s energy data with their existing curriculum. Gateway prepares its urban students through a curriculum emphasizing mathematics and science, integrated with career preparation in highly technical fields. Focused on the importance of education and jobs in STEM fields for America’s future, the President and Chelsea Clinton worked alongside CGI U students to make campus improvements, such as landscaping and performing energy audits.</p>
                    <p>See the buzz from that weekend around solar energy and schools – from social media to news stories – in our Storify post, <a href="http://brightergy.com/media/in-the-news/brightergy-celebrates-solar-energy-with-clintons-and-dorseys/">Brightergy Celebrates Solar Energy with Clintons and Dorseys</a>.</p>
