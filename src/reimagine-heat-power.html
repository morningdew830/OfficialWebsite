                    <h3>HOW CHP WORKS</h3>
                    <p>MicroTurbines work to supplement existing thermal and electric systems. In most cases, the electrical tie-in to your existing building infrastructure is extremely straightforward: once the MicroTurbine is installed, your facility simply receives power from both your turbine and the electrical grid.</p>
                    <p>On the thermal side – in its simplest form – we use exhaust heat to create hot water. That hot water becomes boiler feed water, allowing your existing boiler system to run more efficiently.</p>

                    <h3>CAPSTONE TURBINE CO. – OUR CHP PARTNER</h3>
                    <p>Brightergy Turbines is the exclusive distributor of Capstone MicroTurbines in Missouri and Kansas. The Capstone MicroTurbine is similar to a miniature jet engine, housed in a case the size of a sub-zero refrigerator.</p>
                    <p>A MicroTurbine uses natural gas, propane, biogas, or diesel as fuel to producing electricity, producing waste heat in the process – which it is then designed to repurpose the waste heat it produces and turn it into thermal energy that can be used to heat your building.</p>
                    <p>It’s a highly efficient process, with a small footprint. Capstone MicroTurbines scale from 30 kilowatts (30 kW) to 10 megawatts (MW) with just one moving part supported by patented air bearings – there are no liquid lubricants or coolants to maintain.</p>
